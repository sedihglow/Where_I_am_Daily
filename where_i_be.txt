I reside food wise mostly at

the house of hospitality, blanchet house! (FREE MEILS (seriously))

City team sometimes,

park action sundays and maybe a couple times during the day.

TODAY! probably 6:30 St. Andre Baessette?

Just pick up FOOD RESOURCES BLUE PAGE AT THE LIBRARY>


so i am at the centeral library every day, from 10-5 at some point on my laptop.

currently just look for the hug buddy, with the closed? portal and the D smilie,
:D

When i am not at the centeral library i am usually around the usual spots.

nightstrike was amazing last night!


ALso,

So take the max from beaverton, maybe stop by Vivi's vietnamese for some Pho and
Vermincilli bowels for energy before you catch the max! (or we can later. WHERE
ARE MY 4 MAIDENS IN THE SEA OF ALL MY OTHER MAIDENS)

So you catch the red or blue to city center
Get off at pioneer square, you will see the best philly cheese steaks in town,
at the currently known as THE BLOCK (You can ask about the secret sauce, its
HOT)

then you go uphill till you see the library, passing nordstroms on the right,
left side of nordstroms, on the same side as the BLOCK. You will pass the
library on the max, its after the tunnel.


COME FIND ME MAIDENS, OTHER MAIDENS ARE ON ASSULT.
